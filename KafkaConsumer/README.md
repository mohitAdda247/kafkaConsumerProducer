# Kafka Consumer.

Curious Enough to know the working of Consumer itself??

## How to?

Go to your Apache Kafka bin files based on your OS platform. <br/>
Open terminal/command-prompt there.

```bash
kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic user --from-beginning
```
Hit enter already? (Great...)

Now you need to type your message which you want to store in your database table.
****Follow the exact same format***

## Usage

```bash
{"id": 2,"name": "Apple"}
```
Now go to your postman and you know what to do :P
