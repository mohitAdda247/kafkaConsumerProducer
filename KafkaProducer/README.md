# Kafka Producer.

Curious Enough to know the working of Producer itself??

## How to?

Go to your Apache Kafka bin files based on your OS platform.

Make sure your server and zookeeper are up and running by now.

Open terminal/command-prompt there.

```bash
kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic user --from-beginning
```
Hit enter already? (Great...)

Now hit the API as in controller class and check your command prompt
